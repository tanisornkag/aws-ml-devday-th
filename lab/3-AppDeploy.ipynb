For Kendra, there are plenty of options to optimise the retrieval quality through human feedback, metadata, query optimisation and tuning search relevance to name only a few. However, this is out of scope for this workshop. We would like to point the interested reader to the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/tuning.html) as well as the [Kendra workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/df64824d-abbe-4b0d-8b31-8752bceabade/en-US). \n",
    "- The LLM that we are using for the chat interaction. Here, especially models with larger context windows can be helpful to get wider context. \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, RAG can be a very helpful approach to augment your company internal and external search. The retrieval and LLM quality are of high importance to this approach, and the generated load on the systems can be substantial. Especially here, a careful cost consideration between a token based and an infrastructure based pricing model should be done. \n"
